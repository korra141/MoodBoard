Great! Here's a clear explanation of the **MoodBoard AI** project along with the **tech stack** used:

## 🧠 MoodBoard AI — *Your Personal Visual Diary & Vibe Tracker*

**MoodBoard AI** is a weekend hackathon project that turns your daily moods into a vibrant, visual diary. It blends emotion, color psychology, and image generation to help you reflect, unwind, and track how you feel over time.

### 🪄 What it does
- You type in how you're feeling (“anxious but hopeful”, “sunny and calm”, etc.).
- It generates a matching **color palette** 🎨, **vibe-themed images** 🖼️, and optionally **a music or quote recommendation** 🎶💬.
- You can **save the day's mood** as a tile on a calendar or a timeline — building a personalized "moodboard" over time.
- Ideal for journaling, creative inspiration, or just vibing ✨.
